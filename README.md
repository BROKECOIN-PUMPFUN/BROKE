# BROKE — GitHub Pages site

Dark minimalist landing page for **BROKE** (meme coin).
No hype, no promises, no calls-to-action.

## Deploy
1) Create a GitHub repo (example: `BROKE`)
2) Upload all files to the repo root
3) Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → `main` + `/(root)`

## Customize
- Replace `PASTE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE` in `index.html`
- Replace “soon” links in the Links section when ready
- Replace images in `assets/` if you want new art

## Disclaimer
BROKE is for entertainment and community culture only. Not financial advice.
